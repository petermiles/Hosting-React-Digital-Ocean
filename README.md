# Hosting a React Project on Digital Ocean

  This tutorial is for setting up small personal sites on Digital Ocean, it does not cover the myriad of topics that will be important to long term system management.  But if you're wanting to host personal projects, or portfolio pieces it will get you started.

# Prepping your App to host

We will do some things to help prep your app to be hosted.

## Turn off Create React App's Service Worker

Create React App's built in web service worker creates some problems when you try to server you API and your local files from the same server.  If you haven't already, remove the default web service worker from your `src/index.js` file.  *Delete* the lines that say `registerServiceWorker();` and `import registerServiceWorker from 'register-service-worker'`

### Make sure your server is serving your React App

Before we want to deploy our project, we should make sure that our project is working on our local machine.  If it's not working, open you dev console, look at your terminal output.  And try to figure out what is causing it to break locally.

Up till now we have been using the React Dev Server to serve our react app.  We are going to update this so that it will use a production build of our project.  This will do things such as removing extra white-space, comments, and minify our code so that it's as fast to download as possible.  

Make sure your express.static is pointing to the build folder.  This should be our first middleware.

```
app.use( express.static( `${__dirname}/../build` ) );
```

If you are using browser history, you'll need this to make sure your index.html file is being given on the other routes.

As the LAST endpoint (this needs to run after you've setup all your other endpoints)

```
const path = require('path')
app.get('*', (req, res)=>{
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../build/index.html'));
})
```

Tell create-react-app to use webpack to create a build folder with your latest code.

`npm run build`

`nodemon`

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3030 (or whichever port your backend runs) And make sure that your server is sending the files to the front end.

## Ensure you've setup a .env file, and set node to use it for your project.

*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*

All the configuration that you need different between deployed and local should go into this file.  As well as any keys that you want to be secret.  

*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*

Settings that may need to be different between local and production
Login and Logout links on <a> tags.  We cannot proxy <a> tags, so we have to hard code in the backend address when using the react dev server.  But on our hosted version, we will *not* want to point to localhost.  That will point to your users computer.  So we want to use relative paths in production.

Settings that need to be in a .env to be secret

*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*

* Connection String.  Anyone who has access to your Connection String has access to read and write whatever they want in your database.  So we need to keep that secret.

* API Keys - Any API that charges, or has the potential to charge you money you will want to keep hidden.  If someone gets your AWS key they can run up charges on your account to the tune of $5000 a day.  Amazon is generally really good about helping people who have this happen to them, however, that's going to be 10-15 hours on the phone with the help desk.  Not fun and a terrible experience for you.  Keep you Keys hidden.




*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*
*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*
*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*
*Make sure the .gitignore contains the .env file*

Example .env file

```
REACT_APP_LOGIN="http://localhost:3030/api/auth/login"
REACT_APP_LOGOUT="http://localhost:3030/api/auth/logout"

DOMAIN="brack.auth0.com"
ID="46NxlCzM0XDE7T2upOn2jlgvoS"
SECRET="0xbTbFK2y3DIMp2TdOgK1MKQ2vH2WRg2rv6jVrMhSX0T39e5_Kd4lmsFz"
SUCCESS_REDIRECT="http://localhost:3030/"
FAILURE_REDIRECT="http://localhost:3030/api/auth/login"

CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://vuigx:k8Io23cePdUorndJAB2ijk_u0r4@stampy.db.elephantsql.com:5432/vuigx"
NODE_ENV=development
```

If you did not have this already in your project, you will need to install dotenv.

`npm i dotenv`

Then we are going to check out main server file.
It should contain the following at the beginning of your code (It can go anywhere before you first try to use the process.env variables, but the first line makes sure that it is always available to you);

`require('dotenv').config();`

Double check that your server is still working with this new configuration setting.

# Setup with Digital Ocean

### Sign up for Digital Ocean

  We are using Digital Ocean as our hosting platform.  We have $100 dollar promo codes that you can use for hosting.  The small droplets are $5 a month, so you can have over a year of hosting.  In order to use Digital Ocean, you need either a credit card on file, or you can do payment upfront with PayPal of $5.  Get with a member of the instructional staff if you need a digital ocean promo code.  

### What is a droplet?

A Droplet is digital ocean's cute name for their servers.  A server is a computer that has a public IP address.  An IP address is a set of 4 numbers between 0-255 connected with . IE 124.21.26.122 Anyone who knows this IP address can make a request to a server.  

### Managing our droplet

This droplet is publicly available.  Meaning we are going to want some way to tell the server that we are trying to interact with it, vs all the other people on the internet who may have the IP address.  We *could* try and make a username and password that noone on the internet is going to guess.  But this computer could have a potential hacker try thousands of passwords a minute.  Any password that is going to be good enough to secure your droplet, is going to be a huge pain to memorize and keep secret.   Instead we are going to use SSH keys to create a secure way of us talking with our droplet.

### Create SSH Keys

To create a key we can run the following (in windows must use git-bash)

  ```ssh-keygen -t rsa```

This will start a process to step you through the key generation process.  

First it will ask where you want to save this file.  Use the default unless you already have an SSH key that you need to keep.

Second it will ask you for a passphrase.  This will act as a second layer of security.  In case someone gets ahold of your key, usually by getting ahold of your computer.  Note: It will not show you anything when you type, but it is keeping track of what you save.

Third it will ask you to reenter the same passphrase to make sure you entered the correct one.

  ```sh
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in demo_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in demo_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
cc:28:30:44:01:41:98:cf:ae:b6:65:2a:f2:32:57:b5 user@user.local
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|=*+.             |
|o.               |
| oo              |
|  oo  .+         |
| .  ....S        |
|  . ..E          |
| . +             |
|*.=              |
|+Bo              |
+-----------------+
```

This will create two files on your computer.  ```id_rsa``` and ```id_rsa.pub``` if you used the default. They will be in your ```~/.ssh``` folder.
The one with .pub is your public key, this is what you can give to services like Digital Ocean and Github to identify your computer.  

Go ahead and cat your public key.

```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

It looks like a long string of goblity goop. It is the contents of the whole file.  Starting with the ```ssh-rsa``` and all the way to the ```User@Computer.local``` at the end.  (On windows machine git bash has a habit of including the spaces from the word wrap in the copied string.  For windows users may want to open file with notepad or other editor before copy.)

```sh
ssh-rsaAABC3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDR5ehyadT9unUcxftJOitl5yOXgSi2Wj/s6ZBudUS5Cex56LrndfP5Uxb8+Qpx1D7gYNFacTIcrNDFjdmsjdDEIcz0WTV+mvMRU1G9kKQC01YeMDlwYCopuENaas5+cZ7DP/qiqqTt5QDuxFgJRTNEDGEebjyr9wYk+mveV/acBjgaUCI4sahij98BAGQPvNS1xvZcLlhYssJSZrSoRyWOHZ/hXkLtq9CvTaqkpaIeqvvmNxQNtzKu7ZwaYWLydEKCKTAe4ndObEfXexQHOOKwwDSyesjaNc6modkZZC+anGLlfwml4IUwGv10nogVg9DTNQQLSPVmnEN3Z User@Computer.local
```
Copy the whole thing either from the output, opening the file and copying it, or with the command below.  

```pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

### Adding your SSH Key to Digital Ocean

You'll need to go to your [Security Settings.](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security)

Click on Add SSH key, paste your **public** SSH key into the box.  You can give the key a name to remember which key it is.  I usually recommend a combination of your name, and which computer the key is on.  So something like Brack Macbook.  

### Create Droplet

Now we can spin up a [droplet.](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets)  Click Create Droplet.  Here we can choose what OS we want our server to be, as well as choose some default software to install.  

Select the latest Ubuntu for you server (default)

Select your droplet size.  The smallest droplet should be more than enough for your project.  

Select a data center, probably San Francisco or New York.  The numbers won't matter to much for you.  They roll out new features into different zones at different times, but we're not using any of Digital Ocean's special new features.

You can select additional services such as auto backups. But they cost an extra amount.

Make sure your SSH key is selected.

Name your droplet, you can put multiple projects on a single droplet, so you may not want it to be named after any specific project.

### Connect to your Server

After your droplet has spun up, it will give you it's IP address.  We'll connect to the droplet through the ssh (Secure SHell) command

```ssh root@222.222.222.222```

root is the user that you will connect as.  You can optionally set up [different users](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04) if connecting to a system as the root user all the time makes you queasy.   

### Install Node

Initially an older version of Node is installed on the server, let's go ahead and update it real quick.  

`apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade`  This updates the linux list of software it knows about

`apt-get install nodejs -y;apt-get install npm -y;` This will install nodejs (v4 of node) and npm

`npm i -g n;`

`n ;`  Go to your local terminal and find what version of node you are working with. `node -v` Use that same version

`npm i -g npm;` Update and install the latest stable version of node


## Swap
Swap instructions from [Zac Anger's](https://github.com/zacanger) wonderful [documentation](https://github.com/zacanger/doc).

The most limited resource on your droplet will be RAM. They don't come with much on the $5 tier.
You don't need a whole lot to run your server, but npm and webpack take their fair share. You could pay for more RAM, but you could also just set up a swapfile.



```
touch /swapfile
fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
```

* The swapfile will only be in use till the droplet restarts.
* You can turn off the swapfile by using ```swapoff /swapfile``` After you run your grunt gulp or webpack commands
* If you want to make it so the droplet loads with the swapfile one
* `nano /etc/fstab`. add the following to the bottom:
  `/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0`
* We can also tell the server to use the swap file less frequently by lowering the swapiness
* We should adjust swappiness closer to 0 (from the default 60). `nano /etc/sysctl.conf`
  and add `vm.swappiness=10` to the bottom.

--------

### Clone Project

Now we can get your project cloned to your repo. Make sure you're at your home directory  
```
cd ~
```
Then we can clone the project from Github.  (You'll need to use the https version of the link, unless you create an ssh key on your server to use.)

cd into your project, npm install, and any preprocessing (gulp, grunt, webpack) that you need to do. Also create and setup any config / .env files that are in your .gitignore.    

```
git clone https://link-to-my-repo.com/github/projet.git
cd my-project-folder-name
npm install
```

`touch .env`
`nano .env`

If your project is React with create-react-app run `npm run build` to create the build folder with your code changes.  If this process fails, double check that all your installed dependencies are in your package.json, and you've provided any configuration files you need to have

If you wave a different build process, run that (such as grunt gulp or webpack if you were doing another framework, or custom build process for react)

Now run node to check for any server load errors (in case you forgot to --save all your dependencies.)

```
node server/index.js
```

If you get any errors, npm install those packages, and repeat till the server runs.  

You should now be able to go to ipaddrress:port in your browser to see your project.
```126.152.73.125:8082```

If your server is running on port 80, you can drop specifying the port number.  

### Install pm2

Terminate your node server if it's still running.   We're going to install pm2 (Program Manager 2) a program that will keep your server running after you log out of the server, and will auto restart the server if it crashes.

Then we will tell pm2 to start our server file.

```sh
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server/server.js
```

When you have changes that you want to bring into the project.  Make sure that you've pushed to to github.  Then from your server.  The exact process you do may change a bit depending on how you've set up your project.

```git pull``` This will get the new code onto the server.

```npm build``` (react changes) In case you have a build process that needs to recompile those changes on the server

```pm2 restart all``` (server changes) Restart the server to bring in the new server changes

### Useful Forever Commands

To see the currently running processes: ```pm2 list```

To restart all forever processes: ```pm2 restart all```

To restart a specific process: ```pm2 restart X``` where X is a name or process index.

To Stop all forever processes:```pm2 stop all```

### Postgres

For your projects you have a few options.  You can install Postgres on your server.  Then your project will look at the local machine for it's database the same way that it does when running on your local machine.  The downside to this is if you like working with tools like pgAdmin, it can be difficult to get configured correctly.

Or you can go with a DB as a service such as [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) or [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). ElephantSQL has a free tier with 20MB disk space.  Not a ton, but for small project not needing to worry about it's set up may be worth it.

### Setting Up Domains

Unless you have lots of friends that enjoy accessing websites by ip (You know they exist) You'll want to route your domain to point at your server.  This is slightly different for each register.  Or you can tell the reigstrar to let Digital Ocean manage your routes.  [Here](https://github.com/zacanger/doc/blob/master/digital-ocean.md#domains) is a short description of how to set up Domain records.

[Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-an-a-record-19238)

### NGINX - Optional

If you don't want to use port 80, or you want to put multiple projects on one droplet, we can do that with nginx.

nginx will work like middleware for all the traffic coming to your droplet.  We can use it to watch for specific domain names, or url parameters, then route it to different parts of our droplet based on those factors.

```
sudo apt-get install nginx;
```

Next we are going to go to this folder.
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```
*if this folder does not exist instead go to the `cd /etc/nginx/conf.d` folder*

We can set up each individual servers by editing the default file in this folder.  `nano default`

*if there wasn't a sites-avaiable folder you will use `nano default.conf` instead*  

This example sets up 3 different servers listening for different domains/subdomains.

They all listen to port 80, that's the default port for web-traffic. The server_name should be changed for each server, this is the domain that you want associated with each server.  Also the proxy_pass needs to be changed to match the port each is running on.
```
# Basic server block setup

server {
    listen 80;

    server_name eloeverything.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

# Basic server + www subdomain on a single setup
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name brackcarmony.com www.brackcarmony.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8083;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

# Custom Subdomain Setup
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name data.brackcarmony.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8084;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

# Route based on the url provided after the domain
# This will route traffice that starts with brackcarmony.com/projects/ to port 8084
# putting the / at the end of the proxy_pass will make it so that your server code will
# ignore the /projects/ part of the url. So that you can write your backend server as if it
# were being accessed from just /
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name brackcarmony.com;

    location /projects/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8085/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

After saving and exiting the file.  Run ```sudo service nginx restart```

### SSH config files - Optional

If you want to have an easier way to connect to servers that you use freqently, you can make a config file.
On your computer in the ```~/.ssh``` folder ```touch config``` (no extension)  open it in your editor of choice
We are going to name all the servers we want to keep track of, along with the credentials they use.  

```
Host <nickname> // This will be our nickname for the server
    HostName <myServer.com> // Either the IP address or domain name that you want to connect to
    Port 22 // This is 22 by default for SSH connections
    RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698 // This is if you want to use the rmate or ratom packages
    User username // either root or one of the users you created on the server to run things
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa // Path to private key used for this connection in case you have multiple

Host q
    HostName q.devmountain.com
    Port 22
    RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
    User devmtn
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host brack
    HostName brackcarmoy.com
    Port 22
    RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

After creating this you can just run ```ssh brack``` in place of ```ssh root@brackcarmony.com```
